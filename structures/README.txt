e38_del1_lig_dimer.pdb
   
   I decided to delete residue 39, because this gave me the most flexibility in 
   what to design.  I know I mostly want to keep the structure leading up to 
   residue  38, so I didn't want to make the deletion on that side.  On the 
   otherside, I decided it would be best to delete the residue closest to 
   residue 38 (even though it's a proline that presumably plays an important 
   role in determining the structure of the wildtype loop) so that I will have 
   to option to keep as many of the upstream residues as possible, even though 
   I will probably always decide to design most of them.
