# Design positions
# ================
# This resfile simply encompasses the whole active site loop, the beta 
# strand leading up to it, and the turn on the opposite monomer.  Compared to 
# our previous resfile, this one allows two more positions to design on each 
# side of the active site loop, which we hope will lead to design models that 
# better satisfy the constraints:
#
# Positions 35+37: Previously we excluded these positions because they're 
# pointing into solvent and clearly not affecting the active site loop.  
# Despite that, we now think that the more important thing is to create a more 
# diverse set of backbones in the initial model building step.  Allowing 
# loophash to design the whole loop should help accomplish that.  We'll use 
# LayerDesign in the next step to make sure we still end up with greasy 
# residues on the inside and polar one on the outside.
#
# Positions 45+46: Design the active site loop up to G47.  We don't think it 
# would be wise to include G47 in the design, since it seems to be responsible 
# for breaking the α-helix at position 48.  Previously we stopped at position 
# 44 in hopes of keeping its salt-bridge with E53, but Rosetta usually got rid 
# of that interaction anyways.
# 
# We'll be using LayerDesign and ConsensusLoopDesign to restrict which residues 
# can go where, so the only thing we're specifying here is `NOTAA CH`.  We 
# never want cysteine because it can mess up the global fold by forming 
# unexpected disulfides, and we never want histidine because it's behavior can 
# be pH dependent.

# Repack positions
# ================
# We used Roland and Noah's clash-based repack shell to determine which 
# positions to repack.  This is a good method as long as the backbone won't 
# move too much during design (otherwise you could run into frozen residues).
