# Design positions
# ================
# We chose to design most of these positions (residues 34-44) because they're 
# part of the active site loop.  Position 38 is the catalytic acid, of course.  
#
# We specifically excluded positions 35 and 37 because they are part of the 
# beta sheet and are pointing towards the solvent, so we don't think they will 
# be capable of forming any meaningful interactions with the loop.  We also 
# excluded position 45 because Rosetta insists on replacing it (an arginine) 
# with a hydrophobic residue, which may be detrimental to protein or loop 
# stability.  We are pursuing experimental evidence to support this.
#
# Unlike in previous designs, in this design we included residue 34.  The 
# residue is relatively far from the active site, but its small and pointing 
# towards the core, so we think it could contribute to the design by mutating 
# to a larger residue and pushing the whole loop back.
#
# We're using 'NOTAA WCHMFY' for the active site loop.  We chose these by 
# looking at the frequency with which each amino acid appeared after the model 
# building step with lhKIC.  These were the bottom six (actually in order from 
# most to least rare).  It was pretty clear where to make the cut.  The next 
# most rare amino acids were TRQN..., and they were each ~3x more common than 
# any of WCHMYF.  TRQN are also all considered "surface loop" residues by layer 
# design, while none of WCHMYF are (although 'NOTAA WCHMFY` does include AILV, 
# which layer design doesn't consider "surface loop").
#
# Similarly, we're using 'PIKAA LVIYF' for position 36.  These were the five 
# most common amino acids for this position after the model building step with 
# lhKIC.  They are also all the amino acids considered "core strand" by layer 
# design, with the exception of W.

# Repack positions
# ================
# We used Roland and Noah's clash-based repack shell to determine which 
# positions to repack.  This is a good method as long as the backbone won't 
# move too much during design (otherwise you could run into frozen residues).
