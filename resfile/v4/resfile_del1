# Design positions
# ================
# I chose to design most of these positions (residues 34-45) because they're 
# part of the active site loop.  Position 38 is the catalytic acid, of course.  
#
# I specifically excluded positions 35 and 37 because they are part of the beta 
# sheet and are pointing towards the solvent, so I don't think they will be 
# capable of forming any meaningful interactions with the loop.
#
# Unlike in previous designs, in this design I included residue 34.  The 
# residue is relatively far from the active site, but its small and pointing 
# towards the core, so I think it could contribute to the design by mutating to 
# a larger residue and pushing the the whole loop back.
#
# I also included residues 199 and 200 from the opposite monomer.  These are 
# the two residues on that monomer that most point towards the active site 
# loop.  In previous designs, I'd also included residue 201, but I excluded it 
# this time because it never made any specific designed interactions with the 
# active site loop.  (Residued 199 and 200 didn't make specific interactions 
# either, but I think they're in better position to make steric interactions.)

# Repack positions
# ================
# Every position with CB within 6A of an atom being designed.  In pymol:
# 'select repack, (name cb and not design) within 6 of loop'
#
# I decided to use a 6A repack shell instead of using Roland and Noah's 
# clash-based repack shell because I don't want to run into frozen sidechains 
# if the loop moves a bit.
# Note from Cody: Moved residue 45 from a design position to a repack position
# because Rosetta insists on replacing it with a hydrophobic residue, which may 
# be detrimental to protein or loop stability. Also pursuing experimental evidence
# to support this.
