Active site loop
================
LOOP  26  51  51 0 1

I chose the start and end points of this loop to contain the entire active site 
loop and to be anchored in secondary structural elements.  I included the 
entire beta-strand leading up to Glu38 because I believe that its positioning 
is crucial to the design.

Opposite monomer loop
=====================
LOOP 198 203 203 0 1
